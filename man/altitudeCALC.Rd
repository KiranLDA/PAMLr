\title{Calculate altitude from pressure}
\usage{
altitudeCALC(P, T0 = 288.15, P0 = 1013.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{on-bird pressure in hectopascals}

\item{T0}{temperature at sea level in kelvin (i.e. [celcius + 273.15] OR [(Farenheit âˆ’ 32) * 5/9 + 273.15])}

\item{P0}{pressure at sea level in hectopascals}
}
\value{
altitude in metres, default is calculated according to International Standard Atmosphere model (International Organization for Standardization 1975: ISO 2533:1975)
}
\description{
This opens a java application which allows the user to zoom in and out. In Rstudio it will open in the viewer pane and in base R in an html readers. Note that this can be a bit slow

#load dummy data
